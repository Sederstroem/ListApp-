# ListApp-
V.2 of the listapp. Includes Google sign in and notifications.
Create lists and share them with other users. 
Useful for grocery lists and other shopping lists where one user might want to update a shared list with some items and the list gets updated for every user that has the rights to it.


/* TODO 
I will implement an Anonymous sign in as well. That means the user can create lists just for their own without the need to sign in. 
Useful for when you just want to create a list for private use. 
Later it should be possible to sign in and have access to all your private lists still.
